# How to Update the Website

You can change each webpage's content by going to the folder that the webpage is in and looking at the constant file.
For example, if I wanted to change the about page, I would go to /src/components/About-us folder and look for the constants.tsx file and then change the blurbs.

# How to add images

Add them to the public folder and in the page that they will appear on. Make sure to delete unused images.
