The IM rounding team conducts daily rounds where they visit the patients on their service. During rounds, the medical team presents the state of the patient, shares updates that happened overnight, discusses plans for treatment, and addresses the family’s/patient’s questions and concerns. Additionally, the IM team occasionally sees patients in the Emergency Room who need to be admitted into the hospital for further management.

PULSE members have the unique opportunity to observe the clinical course of patients from admittance to discharge. As Neurology encompasses a broad array of neurological disorders, members are exposed to a wide variety of detection and diagnosis methods, such as imaging and physical examinations.

Cardiology is such a vast field within medicine, where individuals seeking to become cardiologists must specialize in specific cardiology fellowships, one of them being the CCU. Within the CCU, our PULSE members have had the chance to observe patients get admitted into the CCU, discharged from the CCU, and visit the cardiac catheterization lab where different procedures are conducted. Additionally, the CCU team also sees patients in the emergency room who may need to be admitted to the CCU upon presentation of cardiac symptoms. In extreme cardiac emergencies, our PULSE members accompany the medical team onto the helipad to retrieve patients flown into Ronald Reagan Medical Center. The CCU is an intensely-paced environment that offers many unique learning opportunities for our members. ",

Through the Cardiology Outpatient service PULSE students get to watch attendings take patient history, provide a full work up, and create a treatment plan. Attendings encourage learning by letting PULSE students listen to rare heart murmurs and explaining complex imaging, labs, or EKGs of patients. The Cardiology Outpatient service is busy with back to back patients exposure and intensive, hands-on learning experiences.",

The cases that this department work with are complex cases that come from all over the hospital, so this team spends a majority of its time problem-solving and workshopping potential solutions. The rounding team consists of medical students, residents, a nurse practitioner, and a supervising attending. These cases are a unique opportunity for PULSE members to view the interdisciplinary nature of medicine. Even though this medical team is cardiology focused, they pull from a vast overall knowledge of the human body in order to understand how any decision will affect not just the heart but the patient’s health overall. Members are able to learn from physicians’ decision making, thought process, and ability to adapt to frequently changing circumstances. Ultimately, members can gain insight into a very challenging but fulfilling aspect of medicine.",

        department: "Emergency Medicine",
        description: "The Emergency Medicine Department understandably has no rounding team and is by far the most flux in nature of all the services that members shadow. Instead of the common scheduled visit, the calls that ED physicians and nurses receive are incredibly spontaneous, necessitating the ability to work rapidly under constraints on information, time, and resources. The beds are filled from the day to the night, so the Emergency team works like a well-oiled machine to effectively respond to the widest range of cases that could possibly enter Ronald Reagan. This department is an especially valuable experience for our members because they are not constrained with a task: their only job is to learn as much as they can. And from seeing illnesses to traumas to acute crises, the Emergency Medicine Department is the epitome of what a member would want to see on their shift, and the last opportunity they’d want to miss.

Throughout the day, Radiation Oncology attendings and residents meet with numerous patients each day, discussing therapeutic options, forming treatment plans with cancer patients, designing molds for radiation devices, and addressing any questions or concerns that are brought up by the patients or their families. While the service lacks a rounding team due its nature as outpatient, the vast amount of services the department offers serve as incredible learning opportunities for PULSE members.",

I am also the director of the Sub-I for general and complex pediatric care at Mattel Children's Hospital and Santa Monica Medical Center. I was recently appointed an Educator for Excellence at the David Geffen School of Medicine and am active in the development of the medical school curriculum. My interests focus on medical student education, improvement of family bedside rounds, and improving communication with Spanish speaking families. I began working with PULSE in 2015 when we incorporated pediatrics into the rotations. Then I became the Faculty Chair. It has been such a rewarding experience working with all the students. I know that when I was an undergraduate opportunities in the medical field influenced my decision to become a future pediatrician. It is exciting to teach the students during rounds and show them a glimpse into a career a medicine. I am always impressed by their clinical symposium presentations and how far they come throughout each quarter."

As someone who came to UCLA lacking the knowledge and resources it takes to succeed academically and professionally, the community, mentorship, and professional development PULSE offers were fundamental to my sense of conviction in knowing that I belong within this space. After my first year in PULSE, I knew that I wanted to give back to the club and cultivate a space for members to grow personally and professionally. Serving as the Director of Hospital Operations and leading this incredible organization over the past year has been a challenging feat, but I am extremely proud of the progress we have been able to make and the direction the organization is heading towards. Facilitating shadowing opportunities, overseeing the different projects board members put on, and mentoring my Co-Director, Joseph, have been incredibly rewarding.

It sounds incredibly cliche and trite, but it’s such a rarity to come across a group of highly ambitious and goal-oriented people, nevertheless those that hold as much compassion and support for others as my peers in this organization. I count myself deeply lucky to have been able to surround myself with them for my years at UCLA. Along the same vein, working with my Co-Director Ali Al-Saleem has truly been a rich and rewarding experience—whether that’s fostering relationships between physicians and students, listening to members rave about their stories on shift, or hunkering down to organize shadowing for the quarter. In every major aspect, I am indelibly bettered because of my opportunity to serve as a Director of Hospital Operations. My hope now is to continue to give back to PULSE all that I have been given, this year and the next."

I am passionate about promoting a holistic perspective of the medical field and hope to foster learning about the social determinants of health through the Student Research Program. Therefore, it is especially rewarding to lead the PULSE Clinical Symposium, which gives students the chance to present case studies and engage in meaningful discussions with healthcare professionals.

My experiences in PULSE have fostered and affirmed my decision to pursue a career in medicine. PULSE has helped me gain a more intimate insight into the physician-patient relationship and explore a diverse range of specialities. By enriching my understanding of the healthcare field, PULSE has introduced me to new interests to which I have continued to explore within research and other opportunities! So many of my experiences in PULSE in shadowing and our professional development events further examine the many aspects of healthcare, including social determinants of health, to help educate us on a holistic view of medicine.
