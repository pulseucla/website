During Spring Quarter, our event will be hosted in Bruin Plaza on the UCLA campus. Everyone is encouraged to participate in any way they would like, whether it’s by volunteering to shave your head in support, pledging to join the fight, donating toward leading-edge research, or simply spreading the word! Further details will come, but get ready for a day of head shaving, education, generosity, music, games, and refreshments!",

More children die of cancer than of any other disease in the United States according to the Foundation. Join us in supporting those in need by spreading awareness of the disease and raising funds for specially chosen research grants!",
